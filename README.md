# Brain-MM-study

Four CNS and four PNS datasets were analyzed in this study, including two human CNS datasets [18, 19] (GSE67835, 267 cells; GSE97930, 33,722 cells),  two mouse CNS datasets [20, 21] (the Mouse Brain Atlas, 95,753 cells; GSE60361, 1,667 cells), three mouse PNS datasets [20, 22, 23]  (the Mouse Brain Atlas, 2,311 cells; GSE101984, 3,688 cells; GSE197289, 67,991), and a human PNS dataset [23] (GSE197289, 17,223 cells). The mouse PNS dataset, GSE197289, are from  mouse of normal models (PBS) and mouse of two headache models (CSD, IS), while all other datasets are from normal tissue. In CNS and PNS datasets, we studied cell types that considered to be involved in migraine pathophysiology, including CNS cell types (neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia, astrocytes); PNS cell types (peptidergic nociceptors (PEP), non-peptidergic nociceptors (NP), large diameter neurofilament-positive mechanoreceptors (NF), C low threshold mechanoreceptors (cLTMR), Satellite cells, Schwann cells); and neurovascular endothelial cells (vasc/endoth).
